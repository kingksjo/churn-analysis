# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn patterns in a telecommunications company to identify key factors influencing customer departures and provide data-driven recommendations for retention strategies. The analysis uses a dataset of 7,043 customers from California, including detailed information about demographics, services, charges, and satisfaction metrics.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains comprehensive customer information including:
- Demographic data (age, gender, marital status, dependents)
- Service subscriptions (phone, internet, security features)
- Account information (contract type, payment method, monthly charges)
- Customer satisfaction metrics
- Churn status and reasons
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)

## Analysis Focus Areas
1. **Churn Factor Analysis**
   - Identification of primary churn drivers
   - Correlation between service usage and churn
   - Impact of demographic factors on customer retention

2. **Key Performance Indicators**
   - Customer satisfaction scores
   - Service adoption rates
   - Pricing and charge patterns
   - Contract type influence

3. **Customer Segmentation**
   - High-risk customer profiles

   - Demographic patterns

## Key Findings
- Pressure from competitors contributed greatly to customer churn
- Attitude of customer service was also a major contributor to churn.
- There was a significant disatisfaction rating with Internet subscribers.

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations to communicate insights:
- Churn rate by customer segments
- Service adoption patterns
- Customer satisfaction correlation with churn
- CLTV distribution analysis
- Geographic distribution of churn

## Recommendations
